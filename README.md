# Spotify and Genius Profanity Data Analysis

 The Goals of our Project:

  The goal of our project was to figure out if the average amount of profanity an artist uses in their music affects their popularity level. As a group, we believed that more profanity increased popularity and wanted to test this theory with R&B music using Spotify, Genius, and Genius Lyrics.  With this goal we can also determine which R&B artist used the most profanity in their lyrics OR the correlation between profanity (“bad word”) and popularity in R&B music.

Why did we choose this project topic? 
Rhythm and Blues, frequently abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, is a genre of popular music that originated in African-American communities in the 1940s. It is often a mix of soul, hip hop, funk, pop and the blues, often called “love music” in the 1950s. We chose this project topic because we both enjoy R&B music and wanted to embrace something from our culture. We both identify as African American women and use R&B music to elevate our mood, reduce stress, and stimulate nostalgic memories.

The goals that were achieved:
- Using the Spotify API and a list artist that our team created we found the top 10 tracks and the popularity level per song. 
- Using the Genius API we searched for 10 songs per artist and retrieved the path URL. (the path URL is the ending of a ‘genius.com/songs/892719’ that locates the song so we can retrieved the lyrics)
- Using Beautiful Soup we were able to web scrape the lyrics for each song found in our Genius API search. 
- Create database with information about artists, song tracks, and lyrics
- Use database to calculate averages with the data
- Create visualizations from calculated data
- And most of all we’re more confident coders!
